                    <p>Here's all the winners for the GDSC Solution Challenge 2022. In no particular order, the top 3 spots went to Gateway, Blossom, and Xtrinsic. A people's choice award category was also included, and the winner of that was Zero-zone.
                        For prizes, all 10 finalist teams got a bundle of Google swag, certifications, and mentorship from Google. All 10 were also heavily presented in the Demo Day livestream, so be sure to check out all their amazing projects. The top 3 winners also got a $3,000 cash prize, while the rest of the finalists left with a $1,000 cash prize.

                    <p>To support the streamlining of COVID-19 restrictions and protocol processes, the student team behind Gateway created an application which handles many facets of COVID-19 protocol verification tasks. Their app uses peripherals to measure body temperate, verify health ID cards, and even detect facemasks with computer vision ML models running inference on-device.
                        The project is open-sourced and the apparatus is even constructed with 3D-printed pieces, so they want their project to be easily replicated by others so that COVID-19 protocols can be streamlined anywhere easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>The student team behind blossom wanted to make an informative and easily accessible application for young girls starting to experience menstrual cycles. In their app, users can learn extensively about the biological processes, track their own periods, and even search for local sources of hygienic products.
                        Their vision was to provide menstrual education to young girls who live in countries where education on the subject was severely lacking, and to be able to offer it free of charge with a highlight on that educational aspect. They observed that many existing apps are geared towards adults, and often have monetization barriers to entry.
                    </p>
                    <p>To support people suffering from negative mental health situations, the student team behind Xtrinsic wanted to leverage machine learning to help detect potential episodes or discomfort to automatically trigger user-defined soothing actions.
                        For instance, if a person is troubled with frequent nightmares due to trauma, a smart watch running Xtrinsic's app can detect it and start playing soothing music. The technology is also suggested for use in other cases, like detecting bipolar episodes.
                        With an intuitive interface, users can customize actions to fit their needs, and even share data with their physicians.
